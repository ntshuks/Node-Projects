Chat App

Main aims of this project

1 - Dropdown menu with several rooms
2 - Welcome message to users
3 - New USer / User has left message to people in room
4 - User it typing message (not yet implemented)
5 - User can only join one room at a time
6 - User sees members in room
7 - General sanity: must be joined to send message, message must have content, can't select leave unless joined
8 - Both selecting "leave" and navigating away / refreshing events are handled

Security
1 - client side validation for join form and messages to prevent spurious input
2 - client side validation of messages (limit no of characters)

Real World

1 - have clients register and have authenticate before being able to join rooms
2 - Iplement Cors so app can be accessed from remote devices
